## Requirements

Node.js 6.0 

You can install [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script) to make things easy.
Once nvm is installed, you just have to run `nvm install` in the project root folder to install the expected version of Node.js

Next time you want to contribute to the project, do not forget to run `nvm use` in the project root folder to set the
right version of Node.js for your terminal session.

## Install dependencies

```console
$ npm install
```

## Serve app and watch for changes

```console
$ npm start
```

## Build the app for production

```console
$ npm run build
```
